# prim-findspanningtree
I used prim's algorithm to find minimum spanning tree of a given gragh.

Three Inputs are given in each Line including ( Source vertex, Destination vertex ,Weight of edge between src & destination).
For Example:

Input:

A B 3
C B 4
A C 2
D C 5
A D 3
-1

*************************************************
After finding minimum spanning tree output includes selected edges and their weights in the following order:
(src vertex, destination vertex, Weight of edge between src & destination).

And finally I calculated cost of minimum spanning tree.

For Example:

Output:

Edge      weight
A --- B     3
A --- C     2
A --- D     3
